# Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST
# Description

&emsp;• This project demonstrates how to train machine learning and deep learning models to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the &emsp;MNIST dataset.<br>
&emsp;• I implemented three different approaches:<br>
&emsp; &emsp;• Scikit-learn: Logistic Regression baseline model <br>
&emsp; &emsp;• PyTorch: Feedforward Neural Network <br>
&emsp; &emsp;• TensorFlow/Keras: Deep Neural Network <br>
&emsp;• The project helped me understand the complete ML workflow—from loading data and preprocessing to training models, evaluating accuracy, and making predictions.<br>

# Motivation 
&emsp;• I created this project to learn core machine learning concepts and frameworks (NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn), and to demonstrate that I can train, evaluate, and compare models.<br>
&emsp;• This project also prepares me to teach beginners how machine learning models learn patterns from data.<br>

# What I Learned
&emsp;• How to load and preprocess image datasets <br>
&emsp;• The difference between traditional ML models (scikit-learn) and neural networks (PyTorch & TensorFlow)<br>
&emsp;• How backpropagation and gradient descent optimize model parameters <br>
&emsp;• How to evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics<br>
&emsp;• How frameworks differ in training loops (fit() in Keras vs manual loop in PyTorch)<br>
