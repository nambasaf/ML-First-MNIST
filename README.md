# Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST
# Description

• This project demonstrates how to train machine learning and deep learning models to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset.
• I implemented three different approaches:
• Scikit-learn: Logistic Regression baseline model
• PyTorch: Feedforward Neural Network
• TensorFlow/Keras: Deep Neural Network
• The project helped me understand the complete ML workflow—from loading data and preprocessing to training models, evaluating accuracy, and making predictions.

# Motivation 
• I created this project to learn core machine learning concepts and frameworks (NumPy, pandas, PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn), and to demonstrate that I can train, evaluate, and compare models.
• This project also prepares me to teach beginners how machine learning models learn patterns from data.

# What I Learned
• How to load and preprocess image datasets
•The difference between traditional ML models (scikit-learn) and neural networks (PyTorch & TensorFlow)
• How backpropagation and gradient descent optimize model parameters
• How to evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics
 •How frameworks differ in training loops (fit() in Keras vs manual loop in PyTorch)
